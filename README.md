I have been exploring the intersection of Python, HTML, and CSS to create dynamic web pages. This repository showcases a project that combines these technologies to generate a simple web page dynamically using templating.

Project Overviewâœ¨
In this project, I delve into the concept of templating. Templating allows us to generate HTML code dynamically by plugging in information from a Python script. Imagine having a list of animals and their details in your Python code; templating makes it seamless to translate this information into a beautifully crafted web page.

How It Works
Data Loading: Animal information is loaded from a JSON file using Python.
HTML Generation: Using a loop, HTML code is dynamically generated based on the animal data.
Templating in Action: The generated HTML is then plugged into an HTML template, replacing a placeholder with the actual animal information.
Output: The final result is a simple and visually appealing web page that presents information about various animals.
